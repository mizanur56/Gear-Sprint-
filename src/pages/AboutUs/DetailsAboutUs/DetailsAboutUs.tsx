      <h1 className=" text-3xl text-black font-bold mb-4">Our Story</h1>
      <p className=" text-lg mb-8 text-gray-700">
        Founded in 2020,{" "}
        <span className="text-gray-800 font-bold"> GearSprint</span> Shop was
        born out of a desire to make fitness accessible to everyone, regardless
        of their circumstances. As gyms became inaccessible, we recognized the
        need for high-quality, affordable home gym equipment that would inspire
        and support your fitness journey. What started as a simple idea to help
        ourselves and our community stay active has now grown into a brand
        dedicated to transforming spaces into Mighty Gyms.
